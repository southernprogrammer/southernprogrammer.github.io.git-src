I'm a guy from northern Alabama. I grew up in Anniston, AL in the community of Saks.
I went to Jacksonville State University, where I received an Undergraduate and Graduate Degree in Computer Science.
Now I work for a GIS company that is becoming the leader for managing telecommunication networks. I've done a few
small projects over the years including a free classroom control system for teachers to take back the
attention of their students. I also created SageTVRename and BeyondTVRename which are scripts written in php
designed to run on desktop machines in an effort to rename or create symlink files in order for XBMC or Plex to
scrape them correctly. I tossed this up in a forum post and have received many emails over the years about people
utilizing the scripts. I look forward to contributing more to the open source community in the future.
