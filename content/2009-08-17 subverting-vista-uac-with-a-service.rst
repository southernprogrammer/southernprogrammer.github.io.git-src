This is exactly what I was looking for, it took me forever to find it. 
And so here it is: code to subvert vista uac with a service! 
http://www.codeproject.com/KB/vista-security/SubvertingVistaUAC.aspx?display=Print. 
Please thank me later for giving you a link to this.  I needed this to
be able to lock the keyboard and mouse in my CCS project on standard
user accounts on vista.  The only thing.  I could have used this code a
week ago and saved myself a lot of coding.

UPDATE: The Code does not work for XP, so you still have to find ways to
make it work for both.  So the design I made before is still a good way
to do things.  I just need to use this for the keyboard and mouse
blocker.
