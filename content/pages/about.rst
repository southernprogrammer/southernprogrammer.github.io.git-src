I'm a guy from northern Alabama. I grew up in Anniston, AL in the community of Saks.
I went to Jacksonville State University, where I received an Undergraduate and Graduate Degree in Computer Science.
Now I work for a GIS company that is becoming the leader for managing telecommunication networks. I've done a few
small projects over the years including a free classroom control system for teachers to take back the
attention of their students. I also created some scripts to make video files created with dvr software
(SageTV and BeyondTV) be picked up with XBMC or Plex scrapers. I look forward to contributing more to the open source
community in the future.
