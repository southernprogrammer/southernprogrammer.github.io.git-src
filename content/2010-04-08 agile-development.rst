So the software company that I work for `3-GIS <http://www.3-gis.com>`__
has decided to start to adopt some agile development practices.  This
document describes a little bit about why the waterfall process isn't
that great.  It's a primer for "The Daily Scrum" which prepares
developers for a "sprint" which is an iteration of work for the team.
