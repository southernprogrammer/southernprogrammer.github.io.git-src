You may have heard about CCS in my blog post
`here </ccs.html>`__, but here’s a brief description anyway. 
CCS allows teachers to block websites and programs on student computers
(both blacklists and whitelists) as well as perform other actions such
as remote desktop.  The teacher and student software can be found
`here <https://github.com/southernprogrammer/ccs>`__.
The teacher software must be setup first. Then setup the student software on all student machines
using the same configuration.
