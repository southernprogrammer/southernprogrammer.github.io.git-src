You may have heard me talk about `Media
Monkey <http://www.mediamonkey.com/>`__ before.  If not, it is my
favorite music player.  It’s based on the winamp engine but is very
powerful for handling mp3 tags, converting music formats, monitor and
import music (great for amazon mp3 stuff) and has integration with a few
online stores.  There is a free version, but the gold version is only 40
bucks and well worth it if you want a great way to manage your music.

You may also be aware that `PS3 Media
Server <http://ps3mediaserver.blogspot.com/>`__ is a pretty awesome way
to get media content onto a ps3 or other upnp/dlna device.  PS3 Media
Server’s music streaming is very limited.  It just shows the music in a
folder structure.  I did a quick google search and found exactly what I
was looking for.  Someone has written a plugin to access your media
monkey library via the PS3 Media Server.  I now have access to my media
monkey library on my ps3 (playlists included!).
