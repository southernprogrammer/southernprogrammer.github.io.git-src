Recently I went to Give Camp in Birmingham.  It’s an event sponsored by
Microsoft for developers to join together to help non-profits and
charities.  Developers spend the weekend developing software or creating
web sites that the organization needs.  It was a lot of fun and here is
a promotional video.
